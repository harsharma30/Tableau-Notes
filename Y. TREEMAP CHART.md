# TREEMAP CHART
The treemap functions as a visualization composed of nested rectangles. These rectangles represent certain categories within a selected dimension and are ordered in a hierarchy, or “tree.” Quantities and patterns can be compared and displayed in a limited chart space. Treemaps represent part of a whole relationship. 

When analyzing a tree map for insights, the largest box shows the largest part of the whole, while the smallest box shows the smallest part. For a deeper analysis, These boxes can be nested to show many categories. 

 

Treemaps best depict data that needs to show a part-to-whole relationship. Percentages of a measure for each dimension are displayed as squares that, when added together, comprise the whole. Using our Superstore dataset, we can divide the total number of sales into categories. Adding the Product Sub-Category dimension would create “seating,” “tables,” and “lamps”. In this example, three specific items of furniture that fall under their respective categories become smaller nested squares.
