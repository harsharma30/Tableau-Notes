# LABELING AND TOOLTIP ADDITION
The Label and Tooltip Marks Cards can both be used to add written information to a view. The difference is that whatever information is added as a Label will show up on the view itself, while any information added to the tooltips will only show up when an end user hovers over marks on the view.

 This is an important distinction that should be considered when you are authoring in Tableau.

For example, if your visualization will be printed or copied and pasted as a screenshot, you would want to add the information to Label to ensure the information is shown on the view. On the other hand, if you know your end users will be interacting with Tableau, you may opt to save some on-screen real estate by providing the information through tooltips.

 As with the other Marks Cards, labels and tooltips can be customized with specific information by dragging and dropping fields onto the Label and Tooltip Marks Cards, respectively. You can click into each of these two Marks Cards to toggle them on and off, change the formatting, and even type in additional information.

 The six Marks Cards introduced in this post can dramatically improve the depth, design, and user experience of your visualizations.

 Utilizing this functionality will not only help your analyses, it will make your final product more effective with end users.
