# LINE PLOT
A line chart, also referred to as a line graph or a line plot, connects a series of data points using a line. This chart type presents sequential values to help you identify trends. Most of the time, the x-axis (horizontal axis) represents a sequential progression of values. The y-axis (vertical axis) then tells you the values for a selected metric across that progression. This is a common chart and is great to use when you want to show data over time.

A line chart supports monitoring behavior in a set of data. These charts are useful for more than tracking change over time. They also help highlight differences and correlations within your data. Furthermore, a line chart can help a viewer make predictions about what might happen next.

Data that is measured in a continuous progression works well in a line chart format.
