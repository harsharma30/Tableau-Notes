# ENCODING TO MARKS
The Color, Size, and Shape Marks Cards all allow you to “encode” the marks on a view.

Encoding marks adds depth to an analysis by mapping marks to colors, sizes, and / or shapes to add context to a view.

There are now three different legends corresponding with the encoding that was just added.

For consistency, this encoding will conveniently carry through on other views as they are created. For example, if we color a new view by the Segment dimension, Consumer will still be identified as blue, Corporate will still be identified as orange, and Home Office will still be identified as green.

These colors can be changed by clicking on the color legend and mapping new colors.

These three Marks Cards can also be used to change all the marks on the view instead of mapping to a specific dimension.

Instead of placing a dimension on the Marks Cards, click each card to experiment with changing the color, size, or shapes for all of the marks at the same time.
