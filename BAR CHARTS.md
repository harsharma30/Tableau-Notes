# BAR CHARTS

Bar charts enable us to compare numerical values like integers and percentages.
They use the length of each bar to represent the value of each variable. For example,
bar charts show variations in categories or subcategories scaling width or height across 
simple, spaced bars, or rectangles.

Bar charts can represent quantitative measures vertically, on the y-axis, or horizontally, on the x-axis.

Many other variations of bar charts exist. Stacked bar charts, side-by-side bar charts, clustered bar charts, and diverging bar charts are representative examples. Labels and legends help the viewer determine the details included in these charts.

Bar charts show a comparison of different values in subcategories. For example, bar charts can show how much money a small business spends by expense type. They can also show how many different items each department sold within a store across a consistent interval of time.

Bar charts can also show the effectiveness of different strategies or methods to achieve a goal. If you partition a view to show four or five different strategies or methods applied to the exact same subcategories then you can compare the results for each method.
