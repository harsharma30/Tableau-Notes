# GROUPS

You can create a group to combine related members in a field. For example, if you are working with a view that shows average test scores by major, you might want to group certain majors together to create major categories. English and History might be combined into a group called Liberal Arts Majors, while Biology and Physics might be grouped as Science Majors.

 

Groups are useful for both correcting data errors(e.g., combining CA, Calif., and California into one data point) as well as answering "what if" type questions (e.g., "What if we combined the East and West regions?).

 

There are multiple ways to create a group. You can create a group from a field in the Data pane, or by selecting data in the view and then clicking the group icon.
