# SYMBOL MAP
A symbol map leverages our ability to interpret information by overlaying quantitative values onto geographical locations using symbols. The symbol or symbols on a symbol map are often represented by a circle, however they can be any shape of icon.



The map contains symbols that represent values in a data set. These symbols can be of consistent size, shape and color or they can differ (in size, shape, or color) to represent variation of the data.



A symbol map can be used to show location or another form of data that can be applied to geographical locations. For example a symbol map to point out the cities that have been hit by hurricanes throughout a period of time with each symbol sized (scaled) to indicate the total number of hurricanes.
