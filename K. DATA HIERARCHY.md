# DATA HIERARCHY

When you connect to a data source, Tableau automatically separates date fields into hierarchies so you can easily break down the visualization. You can also create your own custom hierarchies. For example, if you have a set of fields named Region, State, and County, you can create a hierarchy from these fields so that you can quickly drill down between levels in the visualization.

To create a hierarchy:

1. In the Data pane, drag a field and drop it directly on top of another field.
2. When prompted, enter a name for the hierarchy and click OK.
3. Drag additional fields into the hierarchy as needed. You can also reorder fields in the hierarchy by dragging them to a new position.

When you add a field from a hierarchy to the visualization, you can quickly drill up or down in the hierarchy to add or subtract more levels of detail.
