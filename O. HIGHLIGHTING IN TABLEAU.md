# HIGHLIGHTING IN TABLEAU

Highlight actions allow you to call attention to marks of interest by coloring specific marks and dimming all others. You can highlight marks in the view using a variety of tools. For example, you can manually select the marks you want to highlight, use the legend to select related marks, use the highlighter to search for marks in context or create an advanced highlight action.

The following table describes the different methods you can use to highlight marks in a view, dashboard, or story.
