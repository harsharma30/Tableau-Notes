# CHOROPLETH MAP
A Choropleth Map is a great option to represent spatial variations of a quantity or amount in a given area.

To create a Choropleth Map, Tableau requires:

- A dimension with a Geographic role (e.g. Country)
- Or a geometry contained in a Spatial file (e.g. Shapefile)
A geographic field alone is not enough to create a meaningful choropleth map.

But it represents the first step.

After adding measures and dimensions, you can deduce helpful information from it.
