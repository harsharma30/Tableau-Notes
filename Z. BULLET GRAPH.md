# BULLET GRAPH

A bullet graph is a bar marked with extra encodings to show progress towards a goal or performance against a reference line. Each bar focuses the user on one measure, bringing in more visual elements to provide additional detail. The bullet graph, designed by Stephen Few, replaces meters and gauges that dominated early dashboards and reports. It provides more information in a smaller space; making it ideal for a compact dashboard.


The bullet graph depicts a single primary measure. It includes measures from other fields to enhance the graphical display for analysis. One might display the current yearâ€™s revenue, measured against a goal, while contrasting it with performance from a previous year. The axis measuring the data uses tick marks and labels to support analysis at a glance. Bullet graphs, being a form of bar chart, start at zero to support visual interpretation of the data.


If you have a target goal that you need to meet at a regular interval of time, a bullet graph will help display your goal, the current data set, and previous data sets all in one visualization. These bullet graphs can stand next to each other and display multiple data sets to provide a sweeping overview of how one system works. The bullet graph is not good for analyzing change-over-time, part-to-whole, flow, or distribution.
