# DUMBBELL CHART
Tableau dumbbell charts, also known as DNA charts, are an alternative visualization choice for illustrating the change between two data points. 

Tableau dumbbell charts are actually dual-axis combination charts, where one of the axes has a mark type of circle and the other has a mark type of line. 

TO CREATE 

The first step to creating a dumbbell chart in Tableau is to create a dot plot with the measure and dimension you want to visualize. 

The second, and actually final, step is to create a second axis with the Sales measure and change its mark type to line.
