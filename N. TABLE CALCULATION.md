# TABLE CALCULATION

A table calculation is a transformation you apply to the values in a visualization. Table calculations are a special type of calculated field that computes the local data in Tableau. They are calculated based on what is currently in the visualization and do not consider any measures or dimensions that are filtered out of the visualization.

You can use table calculations for a variety of purposes, including:

- Transforming values to rankings
- Transforming values to show running totals
- Transforming values to show percent of total
