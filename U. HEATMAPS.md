# HEATMAPS
Tableau heatmap is a visualization where marks on the view are represented using color. And as the density of records increases per mark, a more intense color is displayed (heating up). When displayed as a crosstab – it forms a highlight table.

 

the process of creating a heatmap requires,

- One or more dimensions against
- One or two measures.
- In this case using SAMPLE SUPERSTORE data, I will build my layout as follows,
- Drag Order Date to the columns shelf.
- Drag product Sub-Category to the rows shelf.
- Drag Sales to the text shelf.
- Under Show Me Tab, select ‘Heat Maps’
