# DUAL AXIS MAP
 A dual-axis map is a map with two sets of geographic data overlaid on top of one another.For example, a filled map of U.S. states with data points for each city layered on top.

There are three ways to create a dual-axis map in Tableau:

- By using Tableau Latitude(generated) and Longitude(generated) fields
- By using custom latitude and longitude fields
- By using a combination of Tableau Latitude(generated) and Longitude (generated) fields, and custom latitude and longitude fields
