# FUNNEL CHART
A tableau funnel chart is a type of visualization that represents linear workflows in decreasing order. It visually represents the progression of a business process and helps the user get a systematic view of various data values.

4. Add to the Rows shelf the dimension you want to use to split your funnel.

5. Don’t forget to customize your formatting to get rid of any lines—especially the column dividers and the Zero Line that would otherwise divide your funnel in two.

A funnel—also called a pipeline, a sales process or a cycle—can be used to bring significant clarity to your sales data. Whether you’re interested in identifying customers who are dropping out of the sales process, understanding your buyers’ purchase journey, or visualizing whether you have enough prospects to achieve a sales target, you can do it with a funnel.
