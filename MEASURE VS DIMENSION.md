# MEASURE VS DIMENSION

When you connect to a new data source, Tableau assigns each field in the data source as dimension or measure in the Data pane,
depending on the type of data the field contains. You use these fields to build views of your data.

Dimensions contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data). You can use dimensions to categorize, segment,
and reveal the details in your data. Dimensions affect the level of detail in the view.

Measures contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure. Measures can be aggregated. When you drag a measure into the view,
Tableau applies an aggregation to that measure (by default).
