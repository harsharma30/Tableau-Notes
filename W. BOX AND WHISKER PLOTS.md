# BOX AND WHISKER PLOTS
Box and whisker plots, sometimes known as box plots, are a great chart to use when showing the distribution of data points across a selected measure. These charts display ranges within variables measured. This includes the outliers, the median, the mode, and where the majority of the data points lie in the “box”. These visuals are helpful to compare the distribution of many variables against each other.

 

Box and whisker plots portray the distribution of your data, outliers, and the median. The box within the chart displays around 50 percent of the data points. It summarizes a data set in five marks. The mark with the greatest value is called the maximum. It will likely fall far outside the box. The mark with the lowest value is called the minimum. It will likely fall outside the box on the opposite side as the maximum.

 

Use a box and whisker plot to show the distribution of data within a population. They allow for users to determine where the majority of the points land at a glance. They are even more useful when comparing distributions between members of a category in your data.

 

Use a box and whisker plot when the desired outcome from your analysis is to understand the distribution of data points within a range of values. They also help you determine the existence of outliers within the dataset.
