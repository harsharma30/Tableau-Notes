# SETS IN TABLEAU
Sets in Tableau are used to create subsets of data based on certain conditions defined by the user. For example, a set can be created for having a subset of data of top 10 customers with the highest sales. 

 

There are two types of sets: “dynamic set” and “fixed set”. In Tableau, sets can only be created based on dimension fields.
