# SPARKLINES
A sparkline is a very small line chart, typically drawn without axes or coordinates. It presents the general shape of the variation (typically over time) in some measurement in a simple and highly condensed way.


Stock markets, size of economy, business performance and KPI dashboards are perfect places to make the best use of Sparklines.
