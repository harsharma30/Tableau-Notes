# Introduction
  - **Tableau**: Tableau is a very powerful data visualization tool that can be used by data analysts, scientists, statisticians, etc.
  to visualize the data and get a clear opinion based on the data analysis. Tableau is very famous as it can take in data and produce
  the required data visualization output in a very short time.
 
  - **Dashboard**: A dashboard could also a set of several views, letting you compare a selection of data simultaneously. For example,
    if you’ve got a group of views that you simply review a day, you’ll create a dashboard that displays all the views directly, instead
    of navigating to separate worksheets. Like worksheets, you access dashboards from tabs at the lowest of a workbook. Data in sheets
    and dashboards are connected; once you modify a sheet, any dashboards containing it change, and therefore the other way around.
    Both sheets and dashboards update with the newest available data from the info source.

    Dataset used in the given examples is Dataset.

    For this we have to follow some steps:
    
    Open the Tableau tool and connect a dataset into it. Drag and drop the one sheet of the connected dataset. Click on sheet1 to open
    the tableau worksheet. On clicking Sheet1 you will get whole dataset attributes on the left side and a worksheet for work.

    To create a dashboard you have to form at least one worksheet of any information with any features like crosstab, maps, charts, graphs, etc. For this you have to follow some steps :
    - Ready with the sheets and work for the dashboard.
    - Click on the square+ sign to open a new dashboard.

    - Drag and drop the sheets according to your choice.
    - Add some modifications (optional).
   
    Example 1: In this example, we simply create a dashboard with only one sheet.
